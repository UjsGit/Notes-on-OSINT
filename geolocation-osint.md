```Techniques to identify or narrow down the location of a place, image, or event using publicly available information.```


## ▶ GeoOSINT Methodology & Mindset:
    - Observe before using tools
    - Narrow locations progressively
    - Cross-verify with multiple sources
    - Treat AI outputs as hints, not answers
    


The first step as usual should be the reverse image search via Google lens or [Bing](https://www.bing.com/images) or [Yandex](https://yandex.com/images/)              
If the image contains a famous personality, monument, or recognizable architecture, then it will be a piece of cake.

Some images, when taken with location enabled, may contain metadata (as discussed in Image OSINT).

- **[Google Earth Pro](https://www.google.co.uk/earth/about/versions/#earth-pro)** for Desktop is a powerful tool for historical, spatial, and terrain-based analysis, making it extremely useful for geolocation investigations.
- Google Earth Pro is not just a map viewer — it is a forensic-grade spatial analysis tool for geolocation OSINT.

  Main Features:                      
            -Access to historical satellite imagery              
            -3D terrain and building views               
            -Precise measurement tools              
            -Better control over layers and visualization               

### ▶ Satellite Imagery and comparison with Past:

- **[livingatlas](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/wayback)** provides digital archive of the World Imagery basemap.                             
           You can find different timelines of a place over the years to check how the place looked at that particular time.

- **[Satellites.pro](https://satellites.pro/)** provides world map from all major corporates like Yandex, Google, Apple and also the Opensource Map.                   
          You can find distance between 2 points marking them directly on the map and also distance/time for transportation.

    
- **[Copernicus Browser](https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-playground)**    
     **Goldmine for researchers**
  
  The Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem Browser serves as a central hub for accessing, exploring and utilizing the wealth of Earth observation and environmental data provided by the Copernicus Sentinel constellations, contributing missions, Auxiliary engineering data, on-demand data and more...          
  Read more about this [here](https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/Applications/Browser.html).                  
              
                         
                    
### ▶ Street View:

   Street View is one of the most powerful verification tools in geolocation OSINT.     
   It allows ground-level comparison of locations with real-world visuals.      

- **[Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/)** Google Maps Street View is undoubtedly the most widely used Street View platform.

  🧍 Entering Street View (Procedure):
      
      1. Open Google Maps in a browser.
      2. Locate the yellow Pegman (🧍) at the bottom-right corner.
      3. Click and drag Pegman onto the map.
      4. Blue highlighted roads/areas indicate Street View coverage.
      5. Drop Pegman on a blue area to enter Street View mode.
      6. Navigate using mouse or arrow keys to explore surroundings.
      🟦 Blue lines = Street View available
      ⚪ No blue = no Street View coverage

- **[Apple maps](maps.apple.com)**

- **[Baidu maps](https://www.map.baidu.com)** is comprehensive, China-focused mapping with advanced navigation.

- **[Karta View](https://www.kartaview.org)** enables easy capturing of street level imagery by people all around the world.            
     It is Open Source.            
     Users can contribute by Uploading Imagery via smartphones also.         

- **[Mapillary](https://www.map.mapillary.com)** is similar to karta view.                 
       Anyone can join and collect street-level images, using tools like smartphones or action cameras.



### ▶ AI-Assisted Geolocation:        
```AI-assisted geolocation uses machine learning models to predict the likely location of an image based on visual patterns such as architecture, terrain, vegetation, and infrastructure.```

These tools do not give final answers — they provide starting points.

- **[GeoSpy](http://geospy.ai/)**  Predicts probable location from images

- **[Picarta](http://picarta.ai/)** is an AI-based image geolocation with confidence regions


### ▶ GeoOSINT Practice & Geolocation Games:
```Geolocation games are an effective way to train observation, pattern recognition, and spatial reasoning — all core GeoOSINT skills.```
