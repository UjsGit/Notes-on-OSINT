If you are starting to investigate or maybe check on someone's Social media handle, its recommended to create a personality that doesn't exist.
And for that you should create a name and image that doesn't exist in real life using:

- [FakeNameGenerator](https://www.fakenamegenerator.com/) for Name
- [ThisPersonDoesNotExist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) for AI Image

the main Advantage is Anonymity and also the images used by this method don't come in reverse search.
