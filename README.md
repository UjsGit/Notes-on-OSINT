# OSINT Notebook  
### *A curated collection of tools, techniques, and resources for Open Source Intelligence*

## 📖 Overview  
This repository contains my personal notes and resources on OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)
focused on ethical investigation, verification, and research using publicly
available information.

If you are starting to investigate or maybe check on someone's Social media handle, its recommended to create a personality that doesn't exist.
And for that you should create a name and image that doesn't exist in real life using:

- [FakeNameGenerator](https://www.fakenamegenerator.com/) for Name
- [ThisPersonDoesNotExist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) for AI Image

the main Advantage is Anonymity and also the images used by this method don't come in reverse search.
