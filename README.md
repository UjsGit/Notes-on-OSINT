## üì∑ Images
‚Ä¢Define your purpose with the image.                                                                                                                                                                                 
‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé  ‚Äé -Whether you want to find the Location of a place or Product or Person.  

‚Ä¢First of all do image reverse search using [google lens](https://images.google.com/).  

‚Ä¢[Yandex](https://yandex.com/images/) is a very good alternative. It comes with features like Similar images, sites and color search. 

‚Äé‚Ä¢[TinEye](tineye.com) , [Bing](bing.com/images) are some other alternatives.  

‚Ä¢For GeoOSINT we can also use AI tools like [Geospy](Geospy.in) , [GeoGuessr](geoguessr.com) and [Picarta](Picarta.ai)  

‚Ä¢[PimEyes](pimeyes.com) is popular for finding similar faces across internet, but it has limited features.  

‚Ä¢For Reverse searching an image across several platforms at once use [Image Reverse Search Telegram Bot](https://t.me/reverse_image_search_bot)

If you already know some details, try using google's advance search in images section [like this](https://ibb.co/7y4Jq91)    

### Metadata

‚Ä¢Photos often contain EXIF data (Exchangeable Image File Format).  

‚Ä¢[These](https://ibb.co/QphJfdZ) contains informations like Camera make, Camera model, Date/Time, Orientation, Aperature, Location etc.  

‚Ä¢Some platforms strip out these data but these can provide a valuable info.  

‚Ä¢Before uploading images (especially those shot on camera) you should remove EXIF data from these.  

‚Ä¢[verexif](https://www.verexif.com/en/), [Jimpl](https://jimpl.com/remove-exif/) are few tools to strip exifdata  
‚Äé‚Äé ‚Äé ‚Äé you are just a [google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=remove+exif+data) from finding other options.

‚Ä¢[FotoForensics](https://fotoforensics.com/) provides tools and training for digital picture analysis.
