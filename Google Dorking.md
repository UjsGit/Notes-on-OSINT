## üïµÔ∏è Google Dorks for OSINT
Google Dorking allows you to refine searches and uncover publicly available information that may not be easily visible through normal queries.

Google Dorking uses advanced search operators to find specific data across the web, such as exact text, exposed files like pdf, important links, sensitive directories, and more.  
You just need to type your query with a little bit of operators and words and search results will narrow down from Millions to Thousands.  


| Operator   | Description                         | Example                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `site:`    | Search within a specific site      | `site:example.com`      |
| `intitle:` | Find pages with specific words in the title | `intitle:"index of"` |
| `inurl:`   | Find URLs containing specific text | `inurl:admin`          |
| `filetype:`| Search for specific file types    | `filetype:pdf`         |
| `ext:`     | Same as `filetype:` but for extensions | `ext:xlsx`         |
